# Documentation and artifacts store django application #

This project provides a simple web application written in Django/python that aims at sharing artifacts and documentation in a public or private way. 
It is especially suited to be the companion of a build server that generates the documentation and eg. installers, and needs to make those visible 
to a group of developers. 

The main features are:

* handling projects and associated metadata, such as descriptions, authors, maintainers, repositories, copyright holders, license,
  home page, etc
* organization of projects by series, the meaning of the series is up to the project. It can be a specific release channel (release, beta or even 
  continuous build), a set of packages, etc
* serving HTML documentation: documentation files (zip, tar...) are deflated on the server side and served directly from the web application. Each
  revision is kept (if not explictely removed) and you can track the evolution of the documentation, have consistent release together with documentation, etc
* a small scripting API that let update/push artifacts from remote, which is especially convenient for Continuous Integration servers such as Atlassian Bamboo or Jenkins
* handling a limit on the number of revisions per series, which works well for continuous builds
* permission managment: each of the ressources that are served can have a set of permissions applied to it, which
  can be used to restrict the visibility of internal or intermediate work/project
* not so ugly interface using Bootstrap

## Contribution #
This project is still active and any contribution or feature request is welcome.

## Running the application #
This project is based on the Django framework and has very few dependencies, which makes it easy to run:

```
#!bash

# create a dedicated virtual environment
> virtualenv my_env
> . my_env/bin/activate

# install the dependencies
> pip install django
> pip install Pillow
> pip install markdown
> pip install pygments
```

and now you can just test the application as follow (we deflate Bootstrap which is part of the source code):

```
#!bash
> cd code_doc
> cd src/code_doc/static
> unzip bootstrap-3.2.0-dist.zip
> cd -
> python manage.py migrate
> python manage.py runserver
```

If there is no error message, you can then open a browser and visit http://localhost:8000 .

We do not explain how to deploy this application in production environment.

### Adding a superuser
In order to perform some operations such as adding a project, you need to create a *super user* first.

```
#!bash
> cd code_doc
> python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Adding a project

This can be currently done only from the admin interface of Django:

* open a browser and visit http://localhost:8000/admin
* then add a project there
    * specify a copyright holder
    * specify a license
    * describe the project
    * indicate a maintainer
  
And that is it.
