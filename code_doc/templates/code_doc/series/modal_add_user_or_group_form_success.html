OK This is pretty ugly but this is the best option I have found.
The problem is that although the 'hide', 'hide.bs.modal', 'hidden.bs.modal' events are
triggered when the the Cancel button is used, they are not when the submitted form is valid.

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#modal_add').modal('hide');
    location.reload(true);
