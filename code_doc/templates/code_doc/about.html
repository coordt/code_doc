Welcome to [code_doc](https://bitbucket.org/renficiaud/code_doc) project!
============================

This server is meant 

* to make your projects available to the public or to specific groups and increase their visibility
* to store your wonderful documentation and binaries that you want to share with your team mates.

Ready to set up?
================
You are certainly convinced by the usefulness (or necessity) of this web site. In the sequel 

### How to set up a project?

Now let's talk about configuration. The two ingredients are

* Defining a project
* Defining one or more version for this project

### Create a version



### Markdown format

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is used all over the place using the python [markdown](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/index.html) 
extension and the code highlighter [pygments](http://pygments.org/). The best place to start is to look at [this page](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).   

To insert some code as explanaition, you can do the following

    :::bash
    :::bash
    pip install my_package

If the block above is indented with 4 spaces, then Markdown interprets it as code with the designated language. You can also do

    #!bash
    #!bash
    pip install my_package

instead, and in this case the lines will be numbered. These code blocks can be nested with lists (the indentation then becomes 8 spaces).

----------------------------

# Automated update

One of the nice functionalities of *code doc* is to be able to push things on the server. This enables the 
update from a build server for instance.  

The following steps should be followed:

* have proper credentials that allows you to upload something on this server
* Download the code as follow:

        :::bash
        wget {{request.scheme}}://{{request.get_host}}{% url 'script' %}
        
     

[Link Text]({% url 'script' %})



[[https://code.is.localnet/{% url 'authors_list' %}]]
toto {{request.get_referer|urlize}}
tata {{request.build_absolute_uri|urlize}}
titi {{request.META.HTTP_HOST}}


    ::bash
    > wget {{request.scheme}}://{{request.get_host}}{% url 'authors_list' %}
    > python manage.py runserver
    
    blabla(2, 3)

This is cool 

    #!python

    class toto(object):
      pass



blababla [yaya][scripturl]

[scripturl]: {{request.build_absolute_uri}}{% url 'authors_list' %}

{% endmarkdown_tag %}
